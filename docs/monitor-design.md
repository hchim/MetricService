Each monitor is a periodic task.

## Requirement

- Monitors should be executed based on the given time period among all the node instances (no repeated execution in each time interval).
- Monitoring tasks should be evenly allocated to node instances in the host cluster. After adding monitors or deleting monitors
  , these tasks should be still evenly allocated.
- Monitor updates (add, delete, modify) should be propagated to task scheduler and executors as soon as possible. Task scheduler executor 
  should take the following operations at the earliest time.
  - Add: task scheduler should schedule the task as soon as possible.
  - Delete: Scheduled tasks should be cancelled as soon as possible. Unscheduled tasks should be deleted.
  - Update: Both scheduled and unscheduled tasks should be updated as soon as possible.
- When new node instances are added or when existing node instances are stopped, tasks should still be evenly allocated to node instances.
  - If one node instance is removed, the next iteration of the tasks that scheduled on this instance should not be impacted.
  
## Design

### Task Queue



### Scheduler

The scheduler runs two periodic tasks:

- Task Retrieve
-
